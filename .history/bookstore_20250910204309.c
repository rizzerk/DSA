				1) initBookStore() - Initializes a given bookstore
				2) findBook() - Given a bookstore and a book ID, the function will return 1 if the book is found in the bookstore

				3) insertBookBS() - Function will insert a new book record into the bookstore if and only if the book record still does
									not exist in the bookstore. Also, the inserted record is inserted in its proper place in the booklist
									sorted in ascending order by book ID.
				4) deleteBooksNoStock() - Function will go through all the book records in a bookstore and delete any book record that 
										  has zero stocks.
				5) initCustBkCollection() - Initializes a customer's book collection.
				6) purchaseBook() - Function will go through the list of book records in a bookstore and check if the certain book the customer
									wants to purchase exists in the bookstore. If it does exist, insert that book into the customer's book collection
									if and only if the book still does not exist in the customer's collection. The book is inserted at the last
									part of the customer's collection. Do the necessary increments and decrements. Finally, if insertion was successful,
									call function deleteBooksNoStock() to remove any books in the bookstore that have no more stocks.
