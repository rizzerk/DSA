1. If the Hash() evenly distributes N elements to S subsets (or groups):
  a.) How many on the average is the number of elements in each subnet?
      - N/S;
  b.) What is the running time each of the operations insert, delete, and member?
      - O(1);
2. What is the effect if all N elements are assigned to 1 subnet only?
    - it will behave like simple linked list and in worst case scenario the operations will have a running time of O(N);


    Hash(A) = 1
Hash(B) = 4
Hash(C) = 9
Hash(D) = 9
Hash(E) = 0
Hash(F) = 3
Hash(G) = 4
Hash(H) = 3
