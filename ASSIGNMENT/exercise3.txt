1. If the Hash() evenly distributes N elements to S subsets (or groups):
  a.) How many on the average is the number of elements in each subnet?
      - N/S;
  b.) What is the running time each of the operations insert, delete, and member?
      - O(1);
2. What is the effect if all N elements are assigned to 1 subnet only?
    - it will behave like simple linked list and in worst case scenario the operations will have a running time of O(N);
